Even though it's a small app, for scalability reasons, I still organised the code in several different files and folders.

The backend is on port 8000 and I also used a proxy. The server.js file containing the nodejs(Express) code is located in the 'api' directory. 

I've built the frontend with React and Scss. The page is responsive but since I was only provided one hero image in portrait I decided to centre the background image on wider screens.
